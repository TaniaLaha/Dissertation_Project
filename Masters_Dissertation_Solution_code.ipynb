Urban land use classi/f_ication is typically based on\\nsurveys performed by trained professionals. As such, this task\\nis labor-intensive, infrequent, slow, and costly. As a result, such\\ndata are mostly available in developed countries and big cities that\\nhave the resources and the vision necessary to collect and curate it;\\nthis information is usually not available in many poorer regions,\\nincluding many developing countries [ 9] where it is mostly needed.\\n/T_his paper builds on two recent trends that promise to make\\nthe analysis of urban environments a more democratic and inclu-\\nsive task. On the one hand, recent years have seen signi/f_icant\\nimprovements in satellite technology and its deployment (primar-\\nily through commercial operators), which allows to obtain high\\nand medium-resolution imagery of most urbanized areas of the\\nEarth with an almost daily revisit rate. On the other hand, the\\nrecent breakthroughs in computer vision methods, in particular\\ndeep learning models for image classi/f_ication and object detection,\\nnow make possible to obtain a much more accurate representation\\nof the composition built infrastructure and its environments.\\nOur contributions are to both the applied deep learning literature,\\nand to the incipient study of “smart cities” using remote sensing\\ndata. We contrast state-of-the-art convolutional architectures (the\\nVGG-16 [ 19] and ResNet [ 7] networks) to train classi/f_iers that recog-\\nnize broad land use classes from satellite imagery. We then use the\\nfeatures extracted from the model to perform a large-scale compar-\\nison of urban environments. For this, we construct a novel dataset\\nfor land use classi/f_ication, pairing carefully sampled locations with\\nground truth land use class labels obtained from the Urban Atlas\\nsurvey [ 22] with satellite imagery obtained from Google Maps’s\\nstatic API. Our dataset - which we have made available publicly\\nfor other researchers - covers, for now, 10 cities in Europe (chosen\\nout of the original 300) with 10 land use classes (from the original\\n20). As the Urban Atlas is a widely-used, standardized dataset for\\nland use classi/f_ication, we hope that making this dataset available\\nwill encourage the development analyses and algorithms for ana-\\nlyzing the built infrastructure in urban environments. Moreover,\\ngiven that satellite imagery is available virtually everywhere on\\nthe globe, the methods presented here allow for automated, rapid\\nclassi/f_ication of urban environments that can potentially be applied\\nto locations where survey and zoning data is not available.\\nLand use classi/f_ication refers to the combination of physical\\nland a/t_tributes and what cultural and socio-economic function land\\nserves (which is a subjective judgement by experts) [ 2]. In this paper,\\nwe take the view that land use classes are just a useful discretization\\nof a more continuous spectrum of pa/t_terns in the organization of\\nurban environments. /T_his viewpoint is illustrated in Figure 2: while\\narXiv:1704.02965v2  [cs.CV]  13 Sep 2017Figure 1: Urban land use maps for six example cities. We compare the ground truth ( top row ) with the predicted land use maps,\\neither from using separate data collected from the same city ( middle row ), or using data from all other cities ( bo/t_tom row ).\\nFigure 2: Le/f_t: Comparing urban environments via deep hi-\\nerarchical representations of satellite image samples. Right:\\napproach outline - data collection, classi/f_ication, feature ex-\\ntraction, clustering, validation.\\nsome a/t_tributes (e.g., amount of built structures or vegetation) are\\ndirectly interpretable, some others may not be. Nevertheless, these\\npa/t_terns in/f_luence, and are in/f_luenced by, socio-economic factors\\n(e.g., economic activity), resource use (energy), and dynamic human\\nbehavior (e.g., mobility, building occupancy). We see the work\\non cheaply curating a large-scale land use classi/f_ication dataset\\nand comparing neighborhoods using deep representations that\\nthis paper puts forth as a necessary /f_irst step towards a granular\\nunderstanding of urban environments in data-poor regions.\\nSubsequently, in Section 2 we review related studies that apply\\ndeep learning methods and other machine learning techniques\\nto problems of land use classi/f_ication, object detection, and image\\nsegmentation in aerial imagery. In Section 3 we describe the datasetwe curated based on the Urban Atlas survey. Section 4 reviews the\\ndeep learning architectures we used. Section 5 describes model\\nvalidation and analysis results. We conclude in Section 6.\\nAll the code used to acquire, process, and analyze the data, as\\nwell as to train the models discussed in this paper is available at\\nh/t_tp://www.github.com/adrianalbert/urban-environments.\\n2 LITERATURE\\n/T_he literature on the use of remote sensing data for applications in\\nland use cover, urban planning, environmental science, and others,\\nhas a long and rich history. /T_his paper however is concerned more\\nnarrowly with newer work that employs widely-available data\\nand machine learning models - and in particular deep learning\\narchitectures - to study urban environments.\\nDeep learning methods have only recently started to be deployed\\nto the analysis of satellite imagery. As such, land use classi/f_ication\\nusing these tools is still a very incipient literature. Probably the /f_irst\\nstudies (yet currently only 1-2 years old) include the application\\nof convolutional neural networks to land use classi/f_ication [ 2] us-\\ning the UC Merced land use dataset [ 25] (of 2100 images spanning\\n21 classes) and the classi/f_ication of agricultural images of coﬀee\\nplantations [ 17]. Similar early studies on land use classi/f_ication\\nthat employ deep learning techniques are [ 21], [18], and [ 15]. In\\n[11], a spatial pyramid pooling technique is employed for land use\\nclassi/f_ication using satellite imagery. /T_he authors of these studies\\nadapted architectures pre-trained to recognize natural images from\\nthe ImageNet dataset (such as the VGG16 [ 19], which we also use),\\nand /f_ine-tuned them on their (much smaller) land use data. More\\nrecent studies use the DeepSat land use benchmark dataset [ 1],\\nwhich we also use and describe in more detail in Section 2.1. An-\\nother topic that is closely related to ours is remote-sensing image\\nsegmentation and object detection, where modern deep learning\\nmodels have also started to be applied. Some of the earliest work\\nthat develops and applies deep neural networks for this tasks is thatof [13]. Examples of recent studies include [ 26] and [ 12], where the\\nauthors propose a semantic image segmentation technique com-\\nbining texture features and boundary detection in an end-to-end\\ntrainable architecture.\\nRemote-sensing data and deep learning methods have been put\\nto use to other related ends, e.g., geo-localization of ground-level\\nphotos via satellite images [ 3,24] or predicting ground-level scene\\nimages from corresponding aerial imagery [ 27]. Other applications\\nhave included predicting survey estimates on poverty levels in\\nseveral countries in Africa by /f_irst learning to predict levels of night\\nlights (considered as proxies of economic activity and measured\\nby satellites) from day-time, visual-range imagery from Google\\nMaps, then transferring the learning from this la/t_ter task to the\\nformer [ 9]. Our work takes a similar approach, in that we aim to use\\nremote-sensing data (which is widely-available for most parts of\\nthe world) to infer land use types in those locations where ground\\ntruth surveys are not available.\\nUrban environments have been analyzed using other types of\\nimagery data that have become recently available. In [ 4,14], the\\nauthors propose to use the same type of imagery from Google Street\\nView to measure the relationship between urban appearance and\\nquality of life measures such as perceived safety. For this, they\\nhand-cra/f_t standard image features widely used in the computer\\nvision community, and train a shallow machine learning classi/f_ier\\n(a support vector machine). In a similar fashion, [ 5] trained a\\nconvolutional neural network on ground-level Street View imagery\\npaired with a crowd-sourced mechanism for collecting ground truth\\nlabels to predict subjective perceptions of urban environments such\\nas “beauty”, “wealth”, and “liveliness”.\\nLand use classi/f_ication has been studied with other new data\\nsources in recent years. For example, ground-level imagery has been\\nemployed to accurately predict land use classes on an university\\ncampus [ 28]. Another related literature strand is work that uses\\nmobile phone call records to extract spatial and temporal mobility\\npa/t_terns, which are then used to infer land use classes for several\\ncities [ 6,10,20]. Our work builds on some of the ideas for sampling\\ngeospatial data presented there.\\n2.1 Existing land use benchmark datasets\\nPublic benchmark data for land use classi/f_ication using aerial im-\\nagery are still in relatively short supply. Presently there are two\\nsuch datasets that we are aware of, discussed below.\\nUC Merced. /T_his dataset was published in 2010 [ 25] and con-\\ntains 2100 256 ×256, 1 m/pxaerial RGB images over 21 land use\\nclasses. It is considered a “solved problem”, as modern neural net-\\nwork based classi/f_iers [2] have achieved >95% accuracy on it.\\nDeepSat. /T_he DeepSat [ 1] dataset1was released in 2015. It\\ncontains two benchmarks: the Sat-4 data of 500 ,000 images over 4\\nland use classes ( barren land, trees, grassland, other ), and the Sat-6\\ndata of 405 ,000 images over 6 land use classes ( barren land, trees,\\ngrassland, roads, buildings, water bodies ). All the samples are 28 ×28\\nin size at a 1 m/pxspatial resolution and contain 4 channels (red,\\ngreen, blue, and NIR - near infrared). Currently less than two years\\nold, this dataset is already a “solved problem”, with previous studies\\n[15] (and our own experiments) achieving classi/f_ication accuracies\\n1Available at h/t_tp://csc.lsu.edu/ ∼saikat/deepsat/.of over 99% using convolutional architectures. While useful as input\\nfor pre-training more complex models, (e.g., image segmentation),\\nthis dataset does not allow to take the further steps for detailed\\nland use analysis and comparison of urban environments across\\ncities, which gap we hope our dataset will address.\\nOther open-source eﬀorts. /T_here are several other projects\\nthat we are aware of related to land use classi/f_ication using open-\\nsource data. /T_he TerraPa/t_tern2project uses satellite imagery from\\nGoogle Maps (just like we do) paired with truth labels over a large\\nnumber (450) of detailed classes obtained using the Open Street\\nMap API3. (Open Street Maps is a comprehensive, open-access,\\ncrowd-sourced mapping system.) /T_he project’s intended use is as\\na search tool for satellite imagery, and as such, the classes they\\nemploy are very speci/f_ic, e.g., baseball diamonds, churches, or\\nroundabouts. /T_he authors use a ResNet architecture [ 7] to train a\\nclassi/f_ication model, which they use to embed images in a high-\\ndimensional feature space, where “similar” images to an input image\\ncan be identi/f_ied. A second open-source project related to ours is\\nthe DeepOSM4, in which the authors take the same approach of\\npairing OpenStreetMap labels with satellite imagery obtained from\\nGoogle Maps, and use a convolutional architecture for classi/f_ication.\\n/T_hese are excellent starting points from a practical standpoint,\\nallowing interested researchers to quickly familiarize themselves\\nwith programming aspects of data collection, API calls, etc.\\n3 THE URBAN ENVIRONMENTS DATASET\\n3.1 Urban Atlas: a standard in land use analysis\\n/T_he Urban Atlas [ 22] is an open-source, standardized land use\\ndataset that covers ∼300 European cities of 100 ,000 inhabitants or\\nmore, distributed relatively evenly across major geographical and\\ngeopolitical regions. /T_he dataset was created between 2005-2011 as\\npart of a major eﬀort by the European Union to provide a uniform\\nframework for the geospatial analysis of urban areas in Europe.\\nLand use classi/f_ication is encoded via detailed polygons organized\\nin commonly-used GIS/ESRI shape /f_iles. /T_he dataset covers 20\\nstandardized land use classes. In this work we selected classes of\\ninterest and consolidated them into 10 /f_inal classes used for analysis\\n(see Figure 3). Producing the original Urban Atlas dataset required\\nfusing several data sources: high and medium-resolution satellite\\nimagery, topographic maps, navigation and road layout data, and\\nlocal zoning (cadastral) databases. More information on the method-\\nology used by the Urban Atlas researchers can be obtained from\\nthe European Environment Agency5. We chose expressly to use\\nthe Urban Atlas dataset over other sources (described in Section 2.1\\nbecause i)it is a comprehensive and consistent survey at a large\\nscale, which has been extensively curated by experts and used in\\nresearch, planning, and socio-economic work over the past decade,\\nandii)the land use classes re/f_lect higher-level (socio-economic,\\ncultural) functions of the land as used in applications.\\nWe note that there is a wide variance in the distribution of land\\nuse classes across and within the 300 cities. Figure 3 illustrates\\nthe diﬀerences in the distribution in ground truth polygon areas\\n2h/t_tp://www.terrapa/t_tern.com/\\n3h/t_tp://www.openstreetmap.org\\n4h/t_tps://github.com/trailbehind/DeepOSM\\n5h/t_tp://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/urban-atlas/Figure 3: Ground truth land use distribution (by area) for\\nthree example cities in the Urban Environments dataset.\\nfor each of the classes for three example cities (Budapest, Rome,\\nBarcelona) from the dataset (from Eastern, Central, and Western\\nEurope, respectively). /T_his wide disparity in the spatial distribution\\npa/t_terns of diﬀerent land use classes and across diﬀerent cities\\nmotivates us to design a careful sampling procedure for collecting\\ntraining data, described in detail below.\\n3.2 Data sampling and acquisition\\nWe set out to develop a strategy to obtain high-quality samples\\nof the type (satellite image, ground truth label) to use in training\\nconvolutional architectures for image classi/f_ication. Our /f_irst re-\\nquirement is to do this solely with freely-available data sources,\\nas to keep costs very low or close to zero. For this, we chose to\\nuse the Google Maps Static API6as a source of satellite imagery.\\n/T_his service allows for 25 ,000 API requests/day free of charge. For\\na given sampling location given by (latitude, longitude), we ob-\\ntained 224 ×224 images at a zoom level 17 (around 1 .20m/pxspatial\\nresolution, or ∼250m×250mcoverage for an image).\\n/T_he goals of our sampling strategy are twofold. First, we want\\nto ensure that the resulting dataset is as much as possible balanced\\nwith respect to the land use classes. /T_he challenge is that the classes\\nare highly imbalanced among the ground truth polygons in the\\ndataset (e.g., many more polygons are agricultural land and isolated\\nstructures than airports). Second, the satellite images should be\\nrepresentative of the ground truth class associated to them. To this\\nend, we require that the image contain at least 25% (by area) of\\nthe associated ground truth polygon. /T_hus, our strategy to obtain\\ntraining samples is as follows (for a given city):\\n•Sort ground truth polygons in decreasing order according to\\ntheir size, and retain only those polygons with areas larger than\\n1\\n4(224×1.2m)2=0.06km2;\\n•From each decile of the distribution of areas, sample a propor-\\ntionally larger number of polygons, such that some of the smaller\\npolygons also are picked, and more of the larger ones;\\n•For each picked polygon, sample a number of images propor-\\ntional to the area of the polygon, and assign each image the\\npolygon class as ground truth label;\\n6h/t_tps://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/static-maps/\\nFigure 4: Example satellite images for the original land use\\nclasses in the Urban Atlas dataset.\\nExample satellite images for each of the 10 land use classes in\\nthe Urban Environments dataset are given in Figure 4. Note the\\nsigni/f_icant variety (in color schemes, textures, etc) in environments\\ndenoted as having the same land use class. /T_his is because of several\\nfactors, including the time of the year when the image was acquired\\n(e.g., agricultural lands appear diﬀerent in the spring than in the\\nfall), the diﬀerent physical form and appearance of environments\\nthat serve the same socioeconomic or cultural function (e.g., green\\nurban areas may look very diﬀerent in diﬀerent cities or in even\\nin diﬀerent parts of the same city; what counts as “dense urban\\nfabric” in one city may not be dense at all in other cities), and\\nchange in the landscape during the several years that have passed\\nsince the compilation of the Urban Atlas dataset and the time of\\nacquisition of the satellite image (e.g., construction sites may not\\nre/f_lect accurately anymore the reality on the ground).\\nApart from these training images, we constructed ground truth\\nrasters to validate model output for each city. For that, we de/f_ined\\nuniform validation grids of 100 ×100 (25km×25km )around the\\n(geographical) center of a given city of interest. We take a satellite\\nimage sample in each grid cell, and assign to it as label the class\\nof the polygon that has the maximum intersection area with that\\ncell. Examples of land use maps for the six cities we analyze here\\nare given in Figure 1 (top row). /T_here, each grid cell is assigned the\\nclass of the ground truth polygon whose intersection with the cell\\nhas maximum coverage fraction by area. Classes are color-coded\\nfollowing the original Urban Atlas documentation.\\nIn Table 1 we present summaries of the training (le/f_t) and vali-\\ndation (right) datasets we used for the analysis in this paper. /T_he\\nvalidation dataset consists of the images sampled at the centers of\\neach cell in the 25 km×25kmgrid as discussed above. /T_his dataset\\nconsists of ∼140,000 images distributed across 10 urban environ-\\nment classes from 6 cities: Roma (Rome), Madrid, Berlin, Budapest,\\nBarcelona, and Athina (Athens). Because of the high variation in\\nappearance upon visual inspection, we chose to consolidate severalclasses from the original dataset, in particular classes that indicated\\nurban fabric into “High Density Urban Fabric”, “Medium Density\\nUrban Fabric, and “Low Density Urban Fabric”. As mentioned above\\nand illustrated in Figure 3, we did notice a great disparity in the\\nnumbers and distribution of ground truth polygons for other ex-\\nample cities that we investigated in the Urban Atlas dataset. As\\nsuch,for the analysis in this paper, we have chosen cities where\\nenough ground truth polygons were available for each class (that\\nis, at least 50 samples) to allow for statistical comparisons.\\n4 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\\n4.1 Neural network architectures and training\\nFor all experiments in this paper we compared the VGG-16 [ 19]\\nand ResNet [7, 8] architectures.\\nVGG-16. /T_his architecture [ 19] has become one of the most pop-\\nular models in computer vision for classi/f_ication and segmentation\\ntasks. It consists of 16 trainable layers organized in blocks. It starts\\nwith a 5-block convolutional base of neurons with 3 ×3 receptive\\n/f_ields (alternated with max-pooling layers that eﬀectively increase\\nthe receptive /f_ield of neurons further downstream). Following each\\nconvolutional layer is a ReLU activation function [ 19]. /T_he feature\\nmaps thus obtained are fed into a set of fully-connected layers (a\\ndeep neural network classi/f_ier). See Table 2 for a summary.\\nResNet. /T_his architecture [ 7,8] has achieved state-of-the-art\\nperformance on image classi/f_ication on several popular natural\\nimage benchmark datasets. It consists of blocks of convolutional\\nlayers, each of which is followed by a ReLU non-linearity. As before,\\neach block in the convolutional base is followed by a max-pooling\\noperation. Finally, the output of the last convolutional layer serves\\nas input feature map for a fully-connected layer with a so/f_tmax\\nactivation function. /T_he key diﬀerence in this architecture is that\\nshortcut connections are implemented that skip blocks of convo-\\nlutional layers, allowing the network to learn residual mappings\\nbetween layer input and output. Here we used an implementation\\nwith 50 trainable layers per [7]. See Table 3 for a summary.\\nTransfer learning. As it is common practice in the literature,\\nwe have experimented with training our models on the problem of\\ninterest (urban environment classi/f_ication) starting from architec-\\ntures pre-trained on datasets from other domains ( transfer learning ).\\n/T_his procedure has been shown to yield both be/t_ter performance\\nand faster training times, as the network already has learned to\\nrecognize basic shapes and pa/t_terns that are characteristic of im-\\nages across many domains (e.g., [ 9,12,15]). We have implemented\\nthe following approaches: 1)we used models pre-trained on the\\nImageNet dataset, then further /f_ine-tuned them on the Urban Atlas\\ndataset; and 2)we pre-trained on the DeepSat dataset (See Section\\n2), then further re/f_ined on the Urban Atlas dataset. As expected,\\nthe la/t_ter strategy - /f_irst training a model (itself pre-trained on Ima-\\ngeNet data) on the DeepSat benchmark, and the further re/f_ining\\non the Urban Atlas dataset - yielded the best results, achieving\\nincreases of around 5% accuracy for a given training time.\\nGiven the large amount of variation in the visual appearance\\nof urban environments across diﬀerent cities (because of diﬀerent\\nclimates, diﬀerent architecture styles, various other socio-economic\\nfactors), it is of interest to study to what extent a model learned on\\none geographical location can be applied to a diﬀerent geographicallocation. As such, we perform experiments in which we train a\\nmodel for one (or more) cities, then apply the model to a diﬀerent set\\nof cities. Intuitively, one would expect that, the more neighborhoods\\nand other urban features at one location are similar to those at a\\ndiﬀerent location, the be/t_ter learning would transfer, and the higher\\nthe classi/f_ication accuracy obtained would be. Results for these\\nexperiments are summarized in Figure 6.\\n4.2 Comparing urban environments\\nWe next used the convolutional architectures to extract features\\nfor validation images. As in other recent studies (e.g., [ 9]), we use\\nthe last layer of a network as feature extractor. /T_his amounts to\\nfeature vectors of D=4096 dimensions for the VGG16 architecture\\nandD=2048 dimensions for the ResNet-50 architecture. /T_he\\ncodes x∈RDare the image representations that either network\\nderives as most representative to discriminate the high-level land\\nuse concepts it is trained to predict.\\nWe would like to study how ”similar” diﬀerent classes of urban\\nenvironments are across two example cities (here we picked Berlin\\nand Barcelona, which are fairly diﬀerent from a cultural and archi-\\ntectural standpoint). For this, we focus only on the 25 km×25km,\\n100×100-cell grids around the city center as in Figure 1. To be able\\nto quantify similarity in local urban environments, we construct\\na KD-tree T(using a high-performance implementation available\\nin the Python package scikit-learn [16]) using all the gridded\\nsamples. /T_his data structure allows to /f_ind k-nearest neighbors of a\\nquery image in an eﬃcient way. In this way, the feature space can\\nbe probed in an eﬃcient way.\\n5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\\nIn Figure 1 we show model performance on the 100 ×100 (25 km×\\n25km) raster grids we used for testing. /T_he top row shows ground\\ntruth grids, where the class in each cell was assigned as the most\\nprevalent land use class by area (see also Section 3). /T_he bo/t_tom row\\nshows model predictions, where each cell in a raster is painted in\\nthe color corresponding to the maximum probability class estimated\\nby the model (here ResNet-50). Columns in the /f_igure show results\\nfor each of the 6 cities we used in our dataset. Even at a /f_irst visual\\ninspection, the model is able to recreate from satellite imagery\\nqualitatively the urban land use classi/f_ication map.\\nFurther, looking at the individual classes separately and the con-\\n/f_idence of the model in its predictions (the probability distribution\\nover classes computed by the model), the picture is again qualita-\\ntively very encouraging. In Figure 5 we show grayscale raster maps\\nencoding the spatial layout of the class probability distribution for\\none example city, Barcelona. Particularly good qualitative agree-\\nment is observed for agricultural lands, water bodies, industrial,\\npublic, and commercial land, forests, green urban areas, low density\\nurban fabric, airports, and sports and leisure facilities. /T_he model\\nappears to struggle with reconstructing the spatial distribution of\\nroads, which is not unexpected, given that roads typically appear\\nin many other scenes that have a diﬀerent functional classi/f_ication\\nfor urban planning purposes.Table 1: Urban Environments dataset: sample size summary.\\n(a) Dataset used for training & validation ( 80%and20%, respectively)\\nclass/city athina barcelona berlin budapest madrid roma class\\ntotal\\nAgricultural + Semi-\\nnatural areas + Wet-\\nlands4347 2987 7602 2211 4662 4043 25852\\nAirports 382 452 232 138 124 142 1470\\nForests 1806 2438 7397 1550 2685 2057 17933\\nGreen urban areas 990 722 1840 1342 1243 1401 7538\\nHigh Density Urban\\nFabric967 996 8975 6993 2533 3103 23567\\nIndustrial, commer-\\ncial, public, military\\nand pr…1887 2116 4761 1850 3203 2334 16151\\nLow Density Urban\\nFabric1424 1520 2144 575 2794 3689 12146\\nMedium Density Ur-\\nban Fabric2144 1128 6124 1661 1833 2100 14990\\nSports and leisure fa-\\ncilities750 1185 2268 1305 1397 1336 8241\\nWater bodies 537 408 1919 807 805 619 5095\\ncity total 15234 13952 43262 18432 21279 20824 132983(b)25km×25kmground truth test grids (fractions of city total)\\nclass / city athina barcelona berlin budapest madrid roma\\nAgricultural + Semi-\\nnatural areas + Wet-\\nlands0.350 0.261 0.106 0.181 0.395 0.473\\nAirports 0.003 0.030 0.013 0.000 0.044 0.006\\nForests 0.031 0.192 0.087 0.211 0.013 0.019\\nGreen urban areas 0.038 0.030 0.072 0.027 0.125 0.054\\nHigh Density Urban\\nFabric0.389 0.217 0.284 0.365 0.170 0.215\\nIndustrial, commer-\\ncial, public, military\\nand pr…0.109 0.160 0.190 0.096 0.138 0.129\\nLow Density Urban\\nFabric0.016 0.044 0.012 0.006 0.036 0.029\\nMedium Density Ur-\\nban Fabric0.041 0.025 0.129 0.045 0.042 0.047\\nSports and leisure fa-\\ncilities0.017 0.034 0.080 0.025 0.036 0.025\\nWater bodies 0.005 0.006 0.026 0.044 <0.001 0.004\\nFigure 5: Barcelona: ground truth ( top) and predicted probabilities ( bo/t_tom ).\\nTable 2: /T_he VGG16 architecture [19].\\nBlock 1 Block 2 Block 3 Block 4 Block 5 Block 6\\nConv(3,64)\\nConv(3,64)\\nMax-\\nPool(2,2)Conv(3,128)\\nConv(3,128)\\nMax-\\nPool(2,2)Conv(3,256)\\nConv(3,256)\\nConv(3,256)\\nMax-\\nPool(2,2)Conv(3,512)\\nConv(3,512)\\nConv(3,512)\\nMax-\\nPool(2,2)Conv(3,512)\\nConv(3,512)\\nConv(3,512)\\nMax-\\nPool(2,2)FC(4096)\\nFC(4096)\\nFC(Nclasses )\\nSo/f_tMax\\nTable 3: /T_he ResNet-50 architecture [7].\\nBlock 1 Block 2 Block 3 Block 4 Block 5 Block 6\\nConv(7,64)\\nMax-\\nPool(3,2)3x[Conv(1,64)\\nConv(3,64)\\nConv(3,256)]4x[Conv(1,128)\\nConv(3,128)\\nConv(1,512)]6x[Conv(1,256)\\nConv(3,256)\\nConv(1,1024)]3x[Conv(1,512)\\nConv(3,512)\\nConv(1,2048)]FC(Nclasses )\\nSo/f_tMax\\n5.1 Classi/f_ication results\\nWe performed experiments training the two architectures described\\nin Section 4 on datasets for each of the 6 cities considered, and for\\na combined dataset ( all) of all the cities. /T_he diagonal in Figure 6\\nsummarizes the (validation set) classi/f_ication performance for each\\nmodel. All /f_igures are averages computed over balanced subsets\\nof 2000 samples each. While accuracies or ∼0.70−0.80 may not\\nlook as impressive as those obtained by convolutional architectures\\non well-studied benchmarks and other classi/f_ication tasks (e.g.,natural images from ImageNet or small aerial patches from Deep-\\nSat), this only a/t_tests to the diﬃculty of the task of understanding\\nhigh-level, subjective concepts of urban planning in complex ur-\\nban environments. First, satellite imagery typically contains much\\nmore semantic variation than natural images (as also noted, e.g.,\\nin [2,13]), i.e., there is no “central” concept that the image is of\\n(unlike the image of a cat or a /f_lower). Second, the type of labels we\\nuse for supervision are higher-level concepts (such as “low density\\nurban fabric”, or “sports and leisure facilities”), which are much\\nless speci/f_ic than more physical land features e.g., “buildings” or\\n”trees” (which are classes used in the DeepSat dataset). Moreover,\\ntop-down imagery poses speci/f_ic challenges to convolutional archi-\\ntectures, as these models are inherently not rotationally-symmetric.\\nUrban environments, especially from from a top-down point of\\nview, come in many complex layouts, for which rotations are ir-\\nrelevant. Nevertheless, these results are encouraging, especially\\nsince this is a harder problem by focusing on wider-area images and\\non higher-level, subjective concepts used in urban planning rather\\nthan on the standard, lower-level physical features such as in [ 1] or\\n[17]. /T_his suggests that such models may be useful feature extrac-\\ntors. Moreover, as more researchers tackle problems with the aid of\\nsatellite imagery (which is still a relatively under-researched source\\nof data in the machine learning community), more open-sourceFigure 6: Transferability (classi/f_ication accuracy) of models\\nlearned at one location and applied at another. Training on\\na more diverse set of cities ( all) yields encouraging results\\ncompared with just pairwise training/testing.\\ndatasets (like this one) are released, performance will certainly im-\\nprove. For the remainder of this section we report results using\\nthe ResNet-50 architecture [ 7], as it consistently yielded (if only\\nslightly) be/t_ter classi/f_ication results in our experiments than the\\nVGG-16 architecture.\\nTransfer learning and classi/f_ication performance. Next,\\nwe investigated how models trained in one se/t_ting (city or set of\\ncities) perform when applied to other geographical locations. Figure\\n6 summarizes these experiments. In general, performance is poor\\nwhen training on samples from a given city and testing on samples\\nfrom a diﬀerent city (the oﬀ-diagonal terms). /T_his is expected, as\\nthese environments can be very diﬀerent in appearance for cities as\\ndiﬀerent as e.g., Budapest and Barcelona. However, we notice that\\na more diverse set ( all) yields be/t_ter performance when applied at\\ndiﬀerent locations than models trained on individual cities. /T_his is\\nencouraging for our purpose of analyzing the high level “similarity”\\nof urban neighborhoods via satellite imagery.\\nWe next looked at per-class model performance to understand\\nwhat types of environments are harder for the model to distin-\\nguish. Figure 7 shows such an example analysis for three example\\ncities, of which a pair is “similar” according to Figure 6 (Rome and\\nBarcelona), and another dissimilar (Rome and Budapest). /T_he le/f_t\\npanel shows model performance when training on samples from\\nBarcelona, and predicting on test samples from Barcelona (intra-\\ncity). /T_he middle panel shows training on Rome, and predicting\\non test samples in Barcelona, which can be assumed to be “sim-\\nilar” to Rome from a cultural and architectural standpoint (both\\nLatin cities in warm climates). /T_he right /f_igure shows training on\\nBarcelona, and predicting on test samples in Budapest, which can\\nbe assumed a rather diﬀerent city from a cultural and architectural\\nstandpoint. For all cases, the classes that the model most struggles\\nwith are “High Density Urban Fabric”, “Low Density Urban Fabric,\\nand “Medium Density Urban Fabric”. Considerable overlap can be\\nnoticed between these classes - which is not surprising given the\\nhighly subjective nature of these concepts. Other examples where\\nthe model performance is lower is forests and low-density urban\\nareas being sometimes misclassifed as “green urban areas”, which,again, is not surprising. /T_his is especially apparent in the cross-city\\ncase, where the model struggles with telling apart these classes. For\\nboth the case of training and testing on “diﬀerent cities” (Budapest\\nand Barcelona) and on “similar” cities (Rome and Barcelona), we\\nnote that airports and forests are relatively easier to distinguish.\\nHowever, more subjective, high-level urban-planning concepts such\\nas “high density urban fabric” are harder to infer (and more easily\\nconfused with “medium density” or “low density” urban fabric) in\\nthe case of more similar cities (Rome and Barcelona) rather than\\ndissimilar cities (Budapest and Barcelona). Urban environments\\ncontaining sports and leisure facilities and green areas are under\\nthis view more similar between Rome and Barcelona than they are\\nbetween Budapest and Barcelona.\\nChoosing the spatial scale: sensitivity analysis. So far, we\\nhave presented results assuming that tiles of 250 mis an appropriate\\nspatial scale for this analysis. Our intuition suggested that tiles of\\nthis size have enough variation and information to be recognized\\n(even by humans) as belonging to one of the high-level concepts\\nof land use classes that we study in this paper. However, one\\ncan /f_ind arguments in favor of smaller tile sizes, e.g., in many\\ncities the size of a typical city block is 100 m. /T_hus, we trained\\nmodels at diﬀerent spatial scales and computed test-set accuracy\\nvalues for three example cities, Barcelona, Roma, and Budapest\\n- see Figure 8. It is apparent that, for all example cities, smaller\\nspatial scales (50 m, 100m, 150m) that we analyzed yield poorer\\nperformance than the scale we chose for the analysis in this paper\\n(250m). /T_his is likely because images at smaller scales do not capture\\nenough variation in urban form (number and type of buildings,\\nrelative amount of vegetation, roads etc.) to allow for discriminating\\nbetween concepts that are fairly high-level. /T_his is in contrast with a\\nbenchmark such as DeepSat [ 1] that focuses on lower-level, physical\\nconcepts (“trees”, “buildings”, etc.). /T_here, a good spatial scale is\\nby necessity smaller (28 mfor DeepSat), as variation in appearance\\nand compositional elements is unwanted.\\n5.2 Comparing urban environments\\nFinally, we set to understand, at least on an initial qualitative level,\\nhow “similar” urban environments are to one another, across formal\\nland use classes and geographies. Our /f_irst experiment was to\\nproject sample images for each class and city in this analysis to\\nlower-dimensional manifolds, using the t-SNE algorithm [ 23]. /T_his\\nserves the purpose of both visualization (as t-SNE is widely used\\nfor visualizing high-dimensional data), as well as for providing an\\ninitial, coarse continuous representation of urban land use classes.\\nIn our experiments, we used balanced samples of size N=6000, or\\n100 samples for each of the 10 classes for each city. We extracted\\nfeatures for each of these samples using the allmodels (trained\\non a train set with samples across all cities except for the test one).\\nFigure 9 visualizes such t-SNE embeddings for the six cities in\\nour analysis. For most cities, classes such as low density urban\\nfabric, forests, and water bodies are well-resolved, while sports\\nand leisure facilities seem to consistently blend into other types of\\nenvironments (which is not surprising, given that these types of\\nfacilities can be found within many types of locations that have a\\ndiﬀerent formal urban planning class assigned). Intriguing diﬀer-\\nences emerge in this picture among the cities. For example, greenFigure 7: Example classi/f_ication confusion matrix for land use inference. Le/f_t: training and testing on Barcelona; Middle :\\ntraining on Rome, testing on Barcelona; Right: training on Rome, predicting on Budapest.\\nFigure 8: Sensitivity of training patch size vs test accuracy.\\nFigure 9: t-SNE visualization (the /f_irst 2 dimensions) of ur-\\nban environments (satellite image samples) across six cities.\\nurban spaces seem fairly well resolved for most cities. Commercial\\nneighborhoods in Barcelona seem more integrated with the other\\ntypes of environments in the city, whereas for Berlin they appear\\nmore distinct. Urban water bodies are more embedded with urban\\nparks for Barcelona than for other cities. Such reasoning (with\\nmore rigorous quantitative analysis) can serve as coarse way to\\nbenchmark and compare neighborhoods as input to further analysis\\nabout e.g., energy use, livelihood, or traﬃc in urban environments.\\nFigure 10: Comparing urban environments across cities\\n(with reference to Barcelona) We show relative inter-city\\nsimilarity measures computed as the sum of squares across\\nthe clusters in Figure 9.\\nWe further illustrate how “similar” the six cities we used through-\\nout this analysis are starting oﬀ the embeddings plots in Figure 9.\\nFor each land use class, we compute intra-city sum of squares in\\nthe 2-d t-SNE embedding, and display the results in Figure 10. Note\\nthat the distances are always shown with Barcelona as a reference\\npoint (chosen arbitrarily). For each panel, the normalization is with\\nrespect to the largest inter-city distance for that land use class. /T_his\\nvisualization aids quick understanding of similarity between urban\\nenvironments. For example, agricultural lands in Barcelona are\\nmost dissimilar to those in Budapest. Airports in Barcelona are\\nmost similar to those in Athens, and most dissimilar to those in\\nBerlin and Budapest. Barcelona’s forests and parks are most dissim-\\nilar to Budapest’s. Water bodies in Barcelona are very dissimilar to\\nall other cities. /T_his point is enforced by Figure 11 below, which\\nsuggests that areas marked as water bodies in Barcelona are ocean\\nwaterfronts, whereas this class for all other cities represents rivers\\nor lakes.Figure 11: Samples from three urban environments across\\nour 6 example cities. We sampled the 2-d t-SNE embedding\\nof Figure 9 and queried for the closest real sample to the\\ncentroid using an eﬃcient KD-tree search.\\nFinally, we explore the feature maps extracted by the convolu-\\ntional model in order to illustrate how “similar” the six cities we\\nused throughout this analysis are across three example environ-\\nments, green urban areas, water bodies, and medium density urban\\nfabric. For each city and land use class, we start oﬀ the centroid of\\nthe point cloud in the 2-d space of Figure 9, and /f_ind the nearest\\nseveral samples using the KD-tree method described in Section 4.\\nWe present the results in Figure 11. Visual inspection indicates\\nthat the model has learned useful feature maps about urban envi-\\nronments: the sample image patches show a very good qualitative\\nagreement with the region of the space where they’re sampled from,\\nindicated by the land use class of neighboring points. /Q_ualitatively,\\nit is clear that the features extracted from the top layer of the con-\\nvolutional model allow a comparison between urban environments\\nby high-level concepts used in urban planning.\\n6 CONCLUSIONS\\n/T_his paper has investigated the use of convolutional neural net-\\nworks for analyzing urban environments through satellite imagery\\nat the scale of entire cities. Given the current relative dearth of\\nlabeled satellite imagery in the machine learning community, we\\nhave constructed an open dataset of over 140 ,000 samples over 10\\nconsistent land use classes from 6 cities in Europe. As we continue\\nto improve, curate, and expand this dataset, we hope that it can help\\nother researchers in machine learning, smart cities, urban planning,\\nand related /f_ields in their work on understanding cities.\\nWe set out to study similarity and variability across urban envi-\\nronments, as being able to quantify such pa/t_terns will enable richer\\napplications in topics such as urban energy analysis, infrastructure\\nbenchmarking, and socio-economic composition of communities.\\nWe formulated this as a two-step task: /f_irst predicting urban land\\nuse classes from satellite imagery, then turning this (rigid) clas-\\nsi/f_ication into a continuous spectrum by embedding the features\\nextracted from the convolutional classi/f_ier into a lower-dimensional\\nmanifold. We show that the classi/f_ication task achieves encour-\\naging results, given the large variety in physical appearance of\\nurban environments having the same functional class. Moreover,we exemplify how the features extracted from the convolutional\\nnetwork allow for identifying “neighbors” of any given query im-\\nage, allowing a rich comparison analysis of urban environments by\\ntheir visual composition.\\n/T_he analysis in this paper shows that some types urban envi-\\nronments are easier to infer than others, both in the intra- and\\ninter-city cases. For example, in all our experiments, the models\\nhad most trouble telling apart “high”, “medium”, and “low” den-\\nsity urban environments, a/t_testing to the subjectivity of such a\\nhigh-level classi/f_ication for urban planning purposes. However,\\nagricultural lands, forests, and airports tend to be visually similar\\nacross diﬀerent cities - and the amount of relative dissimilarity can\\nbe quanti/f_ied using the methods in this paper. Green urban areas\\n(parks) are generally similar to forests or to leisure facilities, and\\nthe models do be/t_ter in the intra-city case than predicting across\\ncities. How industrial areas look is again less geography-speci/f_ic:\\ninter-city similarity is consistently larger than intra-city similarity.\\nAs such, for several classes we can expect learning to transfer from\\none geography to another. /T_hus, while it is not news that some\\ncities are more “similar” than others (Barcelona is visually closer to\\nAthens than it is to Berlin), the methodology in this paper allows\\nfor a more quantitative and practical comparison of similarity.\\nBy leveraging satellite data (available virtually world-wide), this\\napproach may allow for a low-cost way to analyze urban envi-\\nronments in locations where ground truth information on urban\\nplanning is not available. As future directions of this work, we\\nplan to i)continue to develop more rigorous ways to compare and\\nbenchmark urban neighborhoods, going deeper to physical ele-\\nments (vegetation, buildings, roads etc.); ii)improve and further\\ncurate the open Urban Environments dataset; and iii)extend this\\ntype of analysis to more cities across other geographical locations.\\nA PRACTICAL TRAINING DETAILS.\\nWe split our training data into a training set (80% of the data) and a\\nvalidation set (the remaining 20%). /T_his is separate from the data\\nsampled for the ground truth raster grids for each city, which we\\nonly used at test time. We implemented the architectures in the\\nopen-source deep learning framework Keras7(with a TensorFlow8\\nbackend). In all our experiments, we used popular data augmenta-\\ntion techniques, including random horizontal and vertical /f_lipping\\nof the input images, random shearing (up to 0 .1 radians), random\\nscaling (up to 120%), random rotations (by at most 15 degrees either\\ndirection). Input images were 224 ×224×3 pixels in size (RGB\\nbands). For all experiments, we used stochastic gradient descent\\n(with its Adadelta variant) to optimize the network loss function (a\\nstandard multi-class cross-entropy), starting with a learning rate of\\n0.1, and halving the rate each 10 epochs. We trained our networks\\nfor at most 100 epochs, with 2000 samples in each epoch, stopping\\nthe learning process when the accuracy on the validation set did\\nnot improve for more than 10 epochs. Given the inherent imbalance\\nof the classes, we explicitly enforced that the minibatches used for\\ntraining were relatively balanced by a weighted sampling proce-\\ndure. For training, we used a cluster of 4 NVIDIA K80 GPUs, and\\ntested our models on a cluster of 48 CPUs.\\n7h/t_tps://github.com/fchollet/keras\\n8www.tensor/f_low.org'"

As such, this task\\nis labor-intensive, infrequent, slow, and costly. As a result, such\\ndata are mostly available in developed countries and big cities that\\nhave the resources and the vision necessary to collect and curate it;\\nthis information is usually not available in many poorer regions,\\nincluding many developing countries [ 9] where it is mostly needed.\\n/T_his paper builds on two recent trends that promise to make\\nthe analysis of urban environments a more democratic and inclu-\\nsive task. On the one hand, recent years have seen signi/f_icant\\nimprovements in satellite technology and its deployment (primar-\\nily through commercial operators), which allows to obtain high\\nand medium-resolution imagery of most urbanized areas of the\\nEarth with an almost daily revisit rate. On the other hand, the\\nrecent breakthroughs in computer vision methods, in particular\\ndeep learning models for image classi/f_ication and object detection,\\nnow make possible to obtain a much more accurate representation\\nof the composition built infrastructure and its environments.\\nOur contributions are to both the applied deep learning literature,\\nand to the incipient study of smart cities using remote sensing\\ndata. We contrast state-of-the-art convolutional architectures (the\\nVGG-16 [ 19] and ResNet [ 7] networks) to train classi/f_iers that recog-\\nnize broad land use classes from satellite imagery. We then use the\\nfeatures extracted from the model to perform a large-scale compar-\\nison of urban environments. For this, we construct a novel dataset\\nfor land use classi/f_ication, pairing carefully sampled locations with\\nground truth land use class labels obtained from the Urban Atlas\\nsurvey [ 22] with satellite imagery obtained from Google Mapss\\nstatic API. Our dataset - which we have made available publicly\\nfor other researchers - covers, for now, 10 cities in Europe (chosen\\nout of the original 300) with 10 land use classes (from the original\\n20). As the Urban Atlas is a widely-used, standardized dataset for\\nland use classi/f_ication, we hope that making this dataset available\\nwill encourage the development analyses and algorithms for ana-\\nlyzing the built infrastructure in urban environments. Moreover,\\ngiven that satellite imagery is available virtually everywhere on\\nthe globe, the methods presented here allow for automated, rapid\\nclassi/f_ication of urban environments that can potentially be applied\\nto locations where survey and zoning data is not available.\\nLand use classi/f_ication refers to the combination of physical\\nland a/t_tributes and what cultural and socio-economic function land\\nserves (which is a subjective judgement by experts) [ 2]. In this paper,\\nwe take the view that land use classes are just a useful discretization\\nof a more continuous spectrum of pa/t_terns in the organization of\\nurban environments. /T_his viewpoint is illustrated in Figure 2: while\\narXiv:1704.02965v2  [cs.CV]  13 Sep 2017Figure 1: Urban land use maps for six example cities.

In Section 3 we describe the datasetwe curated based on the Urban Atlas survey. Section 4 reviews the\\ndeep learning architectures we used.

              " '2 LITERATURE\\n/T_he literature on the use of remote sensing data for applications in\\nland use cover, urban planning, environmental science, and others,\\nhas a long and rich history. /T_his paper however is concerned more\\nnarrowly with newer work that employs widely-available data\\nand machine learning models - and in particular deep learning\\narchitectures - to study urban environments.\\nDeep learning methods have only recently started to be deployed\\nto the analysis of satellite imagery. As such, land use classi/f_ication\\nusing these tools is still a very incipient literature. Probably the /f_irst\\nstudies (yet currently only 1-2 years old) include the application\\nof convolutional neural networks to land use classi/f_ication [ 2] us-\\ning the UC Merced land use dataset [ 25] (of 2100 images spanning\\n21 classes) and the classi/f_ication of agricultural images of coee\\nplantations [ 17]. Similar early studies on land use classi/f_ication\\nthat employ deep learning techniques are [ 21], [18], and [ 15]. In\\n[11], a spatial pyramid pooling technique is employed for land use\\nclassi/f_ication using satellite imagery. /T_he authors of these studies\\nadapted architectures pre-trained to recognize natural images from\\nthe ImageNet dataset (such as the VGG16 [ 19], which we also use),\\nand /f_ine-tuned them on their (much smaller) land use data. More\\nrecent studies use the DeepSat land use benchmark dataset [ 1],\\nwhich we also use and describe in more detail in Section 2.1. An-\\nother topic that is closely related to ours is remote-sensing image\\nsegmentation and object detection, where modern deep learning\\nmodels have also started to be applied. Some of the earliest work\\nthat develops and applies deep neural networks for this tasks is thatof [13]. Examples of recent studies include [ 26] and [ 12], where the\\nauthors propose a semantic image segmentation technique com-\\nbining texture features and boundary detection in an end-to-end\\ntrainable architecture.\\nRemote-sensing data and deep learning methods have been put\\nto use to other related ends, e.g., geo-localization of ground-level\\nphotos via satellite images [ 3,24] or predicting ground-level scene\\nimages from corresponding aerial imagery [ 27]. Other applications\\nhave included predicting survey estimates on poverty levels in\\nseveral countries in Africa by /f_irst learning to predict levels of night\\nlights (considered as proxies of economic activity and measured\\nby satellites) from day-time, visual-range imagery from Google\\nMaps, then transferring the learning from this la/t_ter task to the\\nformer [ 9]. Our work takes a similar approach, in that we aim to use\\nremote-sensing data (which is widely-available for most parts of\\nthe world) to infer land use types in those locations where ground\\ntruth surveys are not available.\\nUrban environments have been analyzed using other types of\\nimagery data that have become recently available. In [ 4,14], the\\nauthors propose to use the same type of imagery from Google Street\\nView to measure the relationship between urban appearance and\\nquality of life measures such as perceived safety. For this, they\\nhand-cra/f_t standard image features widely used in the computer\\nvision community, and train a shallow machine learning classi/f_ier\\n(a support vector machine). In a similar fashion, [ 5] trained a\\nconvolutional neural network on ground-level Street View imagery\\npaired with a crowd-sourced mechanism for collecting ground truth\\nlabels to predict subjective perceptions of urban environments such\\nas beauty, wealth, and liveliness.\\nLand use classi/f_ication has been studied with other new data\\nsources in recent years. For example, ground-level imagery has been\\nemployed to accurately predict land use classes on an university\\ncampus [ 28]. Another related literature strand is work that uses\\nmobile phone call records to extract spatial and temporal mobility\\npa/t_terns, which are then used to infer land use classes for several\\ncities [ 6,10,20]. Our work builds on some of the ideas for sampling\\ngeospatial data presented there.\\n2.1 Existing land use benchmark datasets\\nPublic benchmark data for land use classi/f_ication using aerial im-\\nagery are still in relatively short supply. Presently there are two\\nsuch datasets that we are aware of, discussed below.\\nUC Merced. /T_his dataset was published in 2010 [ 25] and con-\\ntains 2100 256 256, 1 m/pxaerial RGB images over 21 land use\\nclasses. It is considered a solved problem, as modern neural net-\\nwork based classi/f_iers [2] have achieved >95% accuracy on it.\\nDeepSat. /T_he DeepSat [ 1] dataset1was released in 2015. It\\ncontains two benchmarks: the Sat-4 data of 500 ,000 images over 4\\nland use classes ( barren land, trees, grassland, other ), and the Sat-6\\ndata of 405 ,000 images over 6 land use classes ( barren land, trees,\\ngrassland, roads, buildings, water bodies ). All the samples are 28 28\\nin size at a 1 m/pxspatial resolution and contain 4 channels (red,\\ngreen, blue, and NIR - near infrared). Currently less than two years\\nold, this dataset is already a solved problem, with previous studies\\n[15] (and our own experiments) achieving classi/f_ication accuracies\\n1Available at  saikat/deepsat/.of over 99% using convolutional architectures. While useful as input\\nfor pre-training more complex models, (e.g., image segmentation),\\nthis dataset does not allow to take the further steps for detailed\\nland use analysis and comparison of urban environments across\\ncities, which gap we hope our dataset will address.\\nOther open-source eorts. /T_here are several other projects\\nthat we are aware of related to land use classi/f_ication using open-\\nsource data. /T_he TerraPa/t_tern2project uses satellite imagery from\\nGoogle Maps (just like we do) paired with truth labels over a large\\nnumber (450) of detailed classes obtained using the Open Street\\nMap API3. (Open Street Maps is a comprehensive, open-access,\\ncrowd-sourced mapping system.) /T_he projects intended use is as\\na search tool for satellite imagery, and as such, the classes they\\nemploy are very speci/f_ic, e.g., baseball diamonds, churches, or\\nroundabouts. /T_he authors use a ResNet architecture [ 7] to train a\\nclassi/f_ication model, which they use to embed images in a high-\\ndimensional feature space, where similar images to an input image\\ncan be identi/f_ied. A second open-source project related to ours is\\nthe DeepOSM4, in which the authors take the same approach of\\npairing OpenStreetMap labels with satellite imagery obtained from\\nGoogle Maps, and use a convolutional architecture for classi/f_ication.\\n/T_hese are excellent starting points from a practical standpoint,\\nallowing interested researchers to quickly familiarize themselves\\nwith programming aspects of data collection, API calls, etc.',\n",
              " '3 THE URBAN ENVIRONMENTS DATASET\\n3.1 Urban Atlas: a standard in land use analysis\\n/T_he Urban Atlas [ 22] is an open-source, standardized land use\\ndataset that covers 300 European cities of 100 ,000 inhabitants or\\nmore, distributed relatively evenly across major geographical and\\ngeopolitical regions. /T_he dataset was created between 2005-2011 as\\npart of a major eort by the European Union to provide a uniform\\nframework for the geospatial analysis of urban areas in Europe.\\nLand use classi/f_ication is encoded via detailed polygons organized\\nin commonly-used GIS/ESRI shape /f_iles. /T_he dataset covers 20\\nstandardized land use classes. In this work we selected classes of\\ninterest and consolidated them into 10 /f_inal classes used for analysis\\n(see Figure 3). Producing the original Urban Atlas dataset required\\nfusing several data sources: high and medium-resolution satellite\\nimagery, topographic maps, navigation and road layout data, and\\nlocal zoning (cadastral) databases. More information on the method-\\nology used by the Urban Atlas researchers can be obtained from\\nthe European Environment Agency5. We chose expressly to use\\nthe Urban Atlas dataset over other sources (described in Section 2.1\\nbecause i)it is a comprehensive and consistent survey at a large\\nscale, which has been extensively curated by experts and used in\\nresearch, planning, and socio-economic work over the past decade,\\nandii)the land use classes re/f_lect higher-level (socio-economic,\\ncultural) functions of the land as used in applications.\\nWe note that there is a wide variance in the distribution of land\\nuse classes across and within the 300 cities.

Our /f_irst re-\\nquirement is to do this solely with freely-available data sources,\\nas to keep costs very low or close to zero. For this, we chose to\\nuse the Google Maps Static API6as a source of satellite imagery.\\n/T_his service allows for 25 ,000 API requests/day free of charge. For\\na given sampling location given by (latitude, longitude), we ob-\\ntained 224 224 images at a zoom level 17 (around 1 .20m/pxspatial\\nresolution, or 250m250mcoverage for an image).\\n/T_he goals of our sampling strategy are twofold. First, we want\\nto ensure that the resulting dataset is as much as possible balanced\\nwith respect to the land use classes. /T_he challenge is that the classes\\nare highly imbalanced among the ground truth polygons in the\\ndataset (e.g., many more polygons are agricultural land and isolated\\nstructures than airports). Second, the satellite images should be\\nrepresentative of the ground truth class associated to them. To this\\nend, we require that the image contain at least 25% (by area) of\\nthe associated ground truth polygon. /T_hus, our strategy to obtain\\ntraining samples is as follows (for a given city):\\nSort ground truth polygons in decreasing order according to\\ntheir size, and retain only those polygons with areas larger than\\n1\\n4(2241.2m)2=0.06km2;\\nFrom each decile of the distribution of areas, sample a propor-\\ntionally larger number of polygons, such that some of the smaller\\npolygons also are picked, and more of the larger ones;\\nFor each picked polygon, sample a number of images propor-\\ntional to the area of the polygon, and assign each image the\\npolygon class as ground truth label;\\n6\\nFigure 4: Example satellite images for the original land use\\nclasses in the Urban Atlas dataset.\\nExample satellite images for each of the 10 land use classes in\\nthe Urban Environments dataset are given in Figure 4. Note the\\nsigni/f_icant variety (in color schemes, textures, etc) in environments\\ndenoted as having the same land use class. /T_his is because of several\\nfactors, including the time of the year when the image was acquired\\n(e.g., agricultural lands appear dierent in the spring than in the\\nfall), the dierent physical form and appearance of environments\\nthat serve the same socioeconomic or cultural function (e.g., green\\nurban areas may look very dierent in dierent cities or in even\\nin dierent parts of the same city; what counts as dense urban\\nfabric in one city may not be dense at all in other cities), and\\nchange in the landscape during the several years that have passed\\nsince the compilation of the Urban Atlas dataset and the time of\\nacquisition of the satellite image (e.g., construction sites may not\\nre/f_lect accurately anymore the reality on the ground).\\nApart from these training images, we constructed ground truth\\nrasters to validate model output for each city. For that, we de/f_ined\\nuniform validation grids of 100 100 (25km25km )around the\\n(geographical) center of a given city of interest. We take a satellite\\nimage sample in each grid cell, and assign to it as label the class\\nof the polygon that has the maximum intersection area with that\\ncell. Examples of land use maps for the six cities we analyze here\\nare given in Figure 1 (top row). /T_here, each grid cell is assigned the\\nclass of the ground truth polygon whose intersection with the cell\\nhas maximum coverage fraction by area. Classes are color-coded\\nfollowing the original Urban Atlas documentation.\\nIn Table 1 we present summaries of the training (le/f_t) and vali-\\ndation (right) datasets we used for the analysis in this paper. /T_he\\nvalidation dataset consists of the images sampled at the centers of\\neach cell in the 25 km25kmgrid as discussed above. /T_his dataset\\nconsists of 140,000 images distributed across 10 urban environ-\\nment classes from 6 cities: Roma (Rome), Madrid, Berlin, Budapest,\\nBarcelona, and Athina (Athens). Because of the high variation in\\nappearance upon visual inspection, we chose to consolidate severalclasses from the original dataset, in particular classes that indicated\\nurban fabric into High Density Urban Fabric, Medium Density\\nUrban Fabric, and Low Density Urban Fabric. As mentioned above\\nand illustrated in Figure 3, we did notice a great disparity in the\\nnumbers and distribution of ground truth polygons for other ex-\\nample cities that we investigated in the Urban Atlas dataset. As\\nsuch,for the analysis in this paper, we have chosen cities where\\nenough ground truth polygons were available for each class (that\\nis, at least 50 samples) to allow for statistical comparisons.',\n",
              " '4 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\\n4.1 Neural network architectures and training\\nFor all experiments in this paper we compared the VGG-16 [ 19]\\nand ResNet [7, 8] architectures.\\nVGG-16. /T_his architecture [ 19] has become one of the most pop-\\nular models in computer vision for classi/f_ication and segmentation\\ntasks. It consists of 16 trainable layers organized in blocks. It starts\\nwith a 5-block convolutional base of neurons with 3 3 receptive\\n/f_ields (alternated with max-pooling layers that eectively increase\\nthe receptive /f_ield of neurons further downstream). Following each\\nconvolutional layer is a ReLU activation function [ 19]. /T_he feature\\nmaps thus obtained are fed into a set of fully-connected layers (a\\ndeep neural network classi/f_ier). See Table 2 for a summary.\\nResNet. /T_his architecture [ 7,8] has achieved state-of-the-art\\nperformance on image classi/f_ication on several popular natural\\nimage benchmark datasets. It consists of blocks of convolutional\\nlayers, each of which is followed by a ReLU non-linearity. As before,\\neach block in the convolutional base is followed by a max-pooling\\noperation. Finally, the output of the last convolutional layer serves\\nas input feature map for a fully-connected layer with a so/f_tmax\\nactivation function. /T_he key dierence in this architecture is that\\nshortcut connections are implemented that skip blocks of convo-\\nlutional layers, allowing the network to learn residual mappings\\nbetween layer input and output. Here we used an implementation\\nwith 50 trainable layers per [7]. See Table 3 for a summary.\\nTransfer learning. As it is common practice in the literature,\\nwe have experimented with training our models on the problem of\\ninterest (urban environment classi/f_ication) starting from architec-\\ntures pre-trained on datasets from other domains ( transfer learning ).\\n/T_his procedure has been shown to yield both be/t_ter performance\\nand faster training times, as the network already has learned to\\nrecognize basic shapes and pa/t_terns that are characteristic of im-\\nages across many domains (e.g., [ 9,12,15]). We have implemented\\nthe following approaches: 1)we used models pre-trained on the\\nImageNet dataset, then further /f_ine-tuned them on the Urban Atlas\\ndataset; and 2)we pre-trained on the DeepSat dataset (See Section\\n2), then further re/f_ined on the Urban Atlas dataset. As expected,\\nthe la/t_ter strategy - /f_irst training a model (itself pre-trained on Ima-\\ngeNet data) on the DeepSat benchmark, and the further re/f_ining\\non the Urban Atlas dataset - yielded the best results, achieving\\nincreases of around 5% accuracy for a given training time.\\nGiven the large amount of variation in the visual appearance\\nof urban environments across dierent cities (because of dierent\\nclimates, dierent architecture styles, various other socio-economic\\nfactors), it is of interest to study to what extent a model learned on\\none geographical location can be applied to a dierent geographicallocation. As such, we perform experiments in which we train a\\nmodel for one (or more) cities, then apply the model to a dierent set\\nof cities. Intuitively, one would expect that, the more neighborhoods\\nand other urban features at one location are similar to those at a\\ndierent location, the be/t_ter learning would transfer, and the higher\\nthe classi/f_ication accuracy obtained would be. Results for these\\nexperiments are summarized in Figure 6.\\n4.2 Comparing urban environments\\nWe next used the convolutional architectures to extract features\\nfor validation images. As in other recent studies (e.g., [ 9]), we use\\nthe last layer of a network as feature extractor. /T_his amounts to\\nfeature vectors of D=4096 dimensions for the VGG16 architecture\\nandD=2048 dimensions for the ResNet-50 architecture. /T_he\\ncodes xRDare the image representations that either network\\nderives as most representative to discriminate the high-level land\\nuse concepts it is trained to predict.\\nWe would like to study how similar dierent classes of urban\\nenvironments are across two example cities (here we picked Berlin\\nand Barcelona, which are fairly dierent from a cultural and archi-\\ntectural standpoint). For this, we focus only on the 25 km25km,\\n100100-cell grids around the city center as in Figure 1. To be able\\nto quantify similarity in local urban environments, we construct\\na KD-tree T(using a high-performance implementation available\\nin the Python package scikit-learn [16]) using all the gridded\\nsamples. /T_his data structure allows to /f_ind k-nearest neighbors of a\\nquery image in an ecient way. In this way, the feature space can\\nbe probed in an ecient way.',\n",
              " '5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\\nIn Figure 1 we show model performance on the 100 100 (25 km\\n25km) raster grids we used for testing. /T_he top row shows ground\\ntruth grids, where the class in each cell was assigned as the most\\nprevalent land use class by area (see also Section 3). /T_he bo/t_tom row\\nshows model predictions, where each cell in a raster is painted in\\nthe color corresponding to the maximum probability class estimated\\nby the model (here ResNet-50). Columns in the /f_igure show results\\nfor each of the 6 cities we used in our dataset. Even at a /f_irst visual\\ninspection, the model is able to recreate from satellite imagery\\nqualitatively the urban land use classi/f_ication map.\\nFurther, looking at the individual classes separately and the con-\\n/f_idence of the model in its predictions (the probability distribution\\nover classes computed by the model), the picture is again qualita-\\ntively very encouraging. In Figure 5 we show grayscale raster maps\\nencoding the spatial layout of the class probability distribution for\\none example city, Barcelona. Particularly good qualitative agree-\\nment is observed for agricultural lands, water bodies, industrial,\\npublic, and commercial land, forests, green urban areas, low density\\nurban fabric, airports, and sports and leisure facilities. /T_he model\\nappears to struggle with reconstructing the spatial distribution of\\nroads, which is not unexpected, given that roads typically appear\\nin many other scenes that have a dierent functional classi/f_ication\\nfor urban planning purposes.Table 1: Urban Environments dataset: sample size summary.\\n(a) Dataset used for training & validation ( 80%and20%, respectively)\\nclass/city athina barcelona berlin budapest madrid roma class\\ntotal\\nAgricultural + Semi-\\nnatural areas + Wet-\\nlands4347 2987 7602 2211 4662 4043 25852\\nAirports 382 452 232 138 124 142 1470\\nForests 1806 2438 7397 1550 2685 2057 17933\\nGreen urban areas 990 722 1840 1342 1243 1401 7538\\nHigh Density Urban\\nFabric967 996 8975 6993 2533 3103 23567\\nIndustrial, commer-\\ncial, public, military\\nand pr1887 2116 4761 1850 3203 2334 16151\\nLow Density Urban\\nFabric1424 1520 2144 575 2794 3689 12146\\nMedium Density Ur-\\nban Fabric2144 1128 6124 1661 1833 2100 14990\\nSports and leisure fa-\\ncilities750 1185 2268 1305 1397 1336 8241\\nWater bodies 537 408 1919 807 805 619 5095\\ncity total 15234 13952 43262 18432 21279 20824 132983(b)25km25kmground truth test grids (fractions of city total)\\nclass / city athina barcelona berlin budapest madrid roma\\nAgricultural + Semi-\\nnatural areas + Wet-\\nlands0.350 0.261 0.106 0.181 0.395 0.473\\nAirports 0.003 0.030 0.013 0.000 0.044 0.006\\nForests 0.031 0.192 0.087 0.211 0.013 0.019\\nGreen urban areas 0.038 0.030 0.072 0.027 0.125 0.054\\nHigh Density Urban\\nFabric0.389 0.217 0.284 0.365 0.170 0.215\\nIndustrial, commer-\\ncial, public, military\\nand pr0.109 0.160 0.190 0.096 0.138 0.129\\nLow Density Urban\\nFabric0.016 0.044 0.012 0.006 0.036 0.029\\nMedium Density Ur-\\nban Fabric0.041 0.025 0.129 0.045 0.042 0.047\\nSports and leisure fa-\\ncilities0.017 0.034 0.080 0.025 0.036 0.025\\nWater bodies 0.005 0.006 0.026 0.044 <0.001 0.004\\nFigure 5: Barcelona: ground truth ( top) and predicted probabilities ( bo/t_tom ).\\nTable 2: /T_he VGG16 architecture [19].\\nBlock 1 Block 2 Block 3 Block 4 Block 5 Block 6\\nConv(3,64)\\nConv(3,64)\\nMax-\\nPool(2,2)Conv(3,128)\\nConv(3,128)\\nMax-\\nPool(2,2)Conv(3,256)\\nConv(3,256)\\nConv(3,256)\\nMax-\\nPool(2,2)Conv(3,512)\\nConv(3,512)\\nConv(3,512)\\nMax-\\nPool(2,2)Conv(3,512)\\nConv(3,512)\\nConv(3,512)\\nMax-\\nPool(2,2)FC(4096)\\nFC(4096)\\nFC(Nclasses )\\nSo/f_tMax\\nTable 3: /T_he ResNet-50 architecture [7].\\nBlock 1 Block 2 Block 3 Block 4 Block 5 Block 6\\nConv(7,64)\\nMax-\\nPool(3,2)3x[Conv(1,64)\\nConv(3,64)\\nConv(3,256)]4x[Conv(1,128)\\nConv(3,128)\\nConv(1,512)]6x[Conv(1,256)\\nConv(3,256)\\nConv(1,1024)]3x[Conv(1,512)\\nConv(3,512)\\nConv(1,2048)]FC(Nclasses )\\nSo/f_tMax\\n5.1 Classi/f_ication results\\nWe performed experiments training the two architectures described\\nin Section 4 on datasets for each of the 6 cities considered, and for\\na combined dataset ( all) of all the cities. /T_he diagonal in Figure 6\\nsummarizes the (validation set) classi/f_ication performance for each\\nmodel. All /f_igures are averages computed over balanced subsets\\nof 2000 samples each. While accuracies or 0.700.80 may not\\nlook as impressive as those obtained by convolutional architectures\\non well-studied benchmarks and other classi/f_ication tasks (e.g.,natural images from ImageNet or small aerial patches from Deep-\\nSat), this only a/t_tests to the diculty of the task of understanding\\nhigh-level, subjective concepts of urban planning in complex ur-\\nban environments. First, satellite imagery typically contains much\\nmore semantic variation than natural images (as also noted, e.g.,\\nin [2,13]), i.e., there is no central concept that the image is of\\n(unlike the image of a cat or a /f_lower). Second, the type of labels we\\nuse for supervision are higher-level concepts (such as low density\\nurban fabric, or sports and leisure facilities), which are much\\nless speci/f_ic than more physical land features e.g., buildings or\\ntrees (which are classes used in the DeepSat dataset). Moreover,\\ntop-down imagery poses speci/f_ic challenges to convolutional archi-\\ntectures, as these models are inherently not rotationally-symmetric.\\nUrban environments, especially from from a top-down point of\\nview, come in many complex layouts, for which rotations are ir-\\nrelevant. Nevertheless, these results are encouraging, especially\\nsince this is a harder problem by focusing on wider-area images and\\non higher-level, subjective concepts used in urban planning rather\\nthan on the standard, lower-level physical features such as in [ 1] or\\n[17]. /T_his suggests that such models may be useful feature extrac-\\ntors. Moreover, as more researchers tackle problems with the aid of\\nsatellite imagery (which is still a relatively under-researched source\\nof data in the machine learning community), more open-sourceFigure 6: Transferability (classi/f_ication accuracy) of models\\nlearned at one location and applied at another. Training on\\na more diverse set of cities ( all) yields encouraging results\\ncompared with just pairwise training/testing.\\ndatasets (like this one) are released, performance will certainly im-\\nprove. For the remainder of this section we report results using\\nthe ResNet-50 architecture [ 7], as it consistently yielded (if only\\nslightly) be/t_ter classi/f_ication results in our experiments than the\\nVGG-16 architecture.\\nTransfer learning and classi/f_ication performance. Next,\\nwe investigated how models trained in one se/t_ting (city or set of\\ncities) perform when applied to other geographical locations. Figure\\n6 summarizes these experiments. In general, performance is poor\\nwhen training on samples from a given city and testing on samples\\nfrom a dierent city (the o-diagonal terms). /T_his is expected, as\\nthese environments can be very dierent in appearance for cities as\\ndierent as e.g., Budapest and Barcelona. However, we notice that\\na more diverse set ( all) yields be/t_ter performance when applied at\\ndierent locations than models trained on individual cities. /T_his is\\nencouraging for our purpose of analyzing the high level similarity\\nof urban neighborhoods via satellite imagery.\\nWe next looked at per-class model performance to understand\\nwhat types of environments are harder for the model to distin-\\nguish. Figure 7 shows such an example analysis for three example\\ncities, of which a pair is similar according to Figure 6 (Rome and\\nBarcelona), and another dissimilar (Rome and Budapest). /T_he le/f_t\\npanel shows model performance when training on samples from\\nBarcelona, and predicting on test samples from Barcelona (intra-\\ncity). /T_he middle panel shows training on Rome, and predicting\\non test samples in Barcelona, which can be assumed to be sim-\\nilar to Rome from a cultural and architectural standpoint (both\\nLatin cities in warm climates). /T_he right /f_igure shows training on\\nBarcelona, and predicting on test samples in Budapest, which can\\nbe assumed a rather dierent city from a cultural and architectural\\nstandpoint. For all cases, the classes that the model most struggles\\nwith are High Density Urban Fabric, Low Density Urban Fabric,\\nand Medium Density Urban Fabric. Considerable overlap can be\\nnoticed between these classes - which is not surprising given the\\nhighly subjective nature of these concepts. Other examples where\\nthe model performance is lower is forests and low-density urban\\nareas being sometimes misclassifed as green urban areas, which,again, is not surprising. /T_his is especially apparent in the cross-city\\ncase, where the model struggles with telling apart these classes. For\\nboth the case of training and testing on dierent cities (Budapest\\nand Barcelona) and on similar cities (Rome and Barcelona), we\\nnote that airports and forests are relatively easier to distinguish.\\nHowever, more subjective, high-level urban-planning concepts such\\nas high density urban fabric are harder to infer (and more easily\\nconfused with medium density or low density urban fabric) in\\nthe case of more similar cities (Rome and Barcelona) rather than\\ndissimilar cities (Budapest and Barcelona). Urban environments\\ncontaining sports and leisure facilities and green areas are under\\nthis view more similar between Rome and Barcelona than they are\\nbetween Budapest and Barcelona.\\nChoosing the spatial scale: sensitivity analysis. So far, we\\nhave presented results assuming that tiles of 250 mis an appropriate\\nspatial scale for this analysis. Our intuition suggested that tiles of\\nthis size have enough variation and information to be recognized\\n(even by humans) as belonging to one of the high-level concepts\\nof land use classes that we study in this paper. However, one\\ncan /f_ind arguments in favor of smaller tile sizes, e.g., in many\\ncities the size of a typical city block is 100 m. /T_hus, we trained\\nmodels at dierent spatial scales and computed test-set accuracy\\nvalues for three example cities, Barcelona, Roma, and Budapest\\n- see Figure 8. It is apparent that, for all example cities, smaller\\nspatial scales (50 m, 100m, 150m) that we analyzed yield poorer\\nperformance than the scale we chose for the analysis in this paper\\n(250m). /T_his is likely because images at smaller scales do not capture\\nenough variation in urban form (number and type of buildings,\\nrelative amount of vegetation, roads etc.) to allow for discriminating\\nbetween concepts that are fairly high-level. /T_his is in contrast with a\\nbenchmark such as DeepSat [ 1] that focuses on lower-level, physical\\nconcepts (trees, buildings, etc.). /T_here, a good spatial scale is\\nby necessity smaller (28 mfor DeepSat), as variation in appearance\\nand compositional elements is unwanted.\\n5.2 Comparing urban environments\\nFinally, we set to understand, at least on an initial qualitative level,\\nhow similar urban environments are to one another, across formal\\nland use classes and geographies. Our /f_irst experiment was to\\nproject sample images for each class and city in this analysis to\\nlower-dimensional manifolds, using the t-SNE algorithm [ 23]. /T_his\\nserves the purpose of both visualization (as t-SNE is widely used\\nfor visualizing high-dimensional data), as well as for providing an\\ninitial, coarse continuous representation of urban land use classes.\\nIn our experiments, we used balanced samples of size N=6000, or\\n100 samples for each of the 10 classes for each city. We extracted\\nfeatures for each of these samples using the allmodels (trained\\non a train set with samples across all cities except for the test one).\\nFigure 9 visualizes such t-SNE embeddings for the six cities in\\nour analysis. For most cities, classes such as low density urban\\nfabric, forests, and water bodies are well-resolved, while sports\\nand leisure facilities seem to consistently blend into other types of\\nenvironments (which is not surprising, given that these types of\\nfacilities can be found within many types of locations that have a\\ndierent formal urban planning class assigned). Intriguing dier-\\nences emerge in this picture among the cities. For example, greenFigure 7: Example classi/f_ication confusion matrix for land use inference. Le/f_t: training and testing on Barcelona; Middle :\\ntraining on Rome, testing on Barcelona; Right: training on Rome, predicting on Budapest.\\nFigure 8: Sensitivity of training patch size vs test accuracy.\\nFigure 9: t-SNE visualization (the /f_irst 2 dimensions) of ur-\\nban environments (satellite image samples) across six cities.\\nurban spaces seem fairly well resolved for most cities. Commercial\\nneighborhoods in Barcelona seem more integrated with the other\\ntypes of environments in the city, whereas for Berlin they appear\\nmore distinct. Urban water bodies are more embedded with urban\\nparks for Barcelona than for other cities. Such reasoning (with\\nmore rigorous quantitative analysis) can serve as coarse way to\\nbenchmark and compare neighborhoods as input to further analysis\\nabout e.g., energy use, livelihood, or trac in urban environments.\\nFigure 10: Comparing urban environments across cities\\n(with reference to Barcelona) We show relative inter-city\\nsimilarity measures computed as the sum of squares across\\nthe clusters in Figure 9.\\nWe further illustrate how similar the six cities we used through-\\nout this analysis are starting o the embeddings plots in Figure 9.\\nFor each land use class, we compute intra-city sum of squares in\\nthe 2-d t-SNE embedding, and display the results in Figure 10. Note\\nthat the distances are always shown with Barcelona as a reference\\npoint (chosen arbitrarily). For each panel, the normalization is with\\nrespect to the largest inter-city distance for that land use class. /T_his\\nvisualization aids quick understanding of similarity between urban\\nenvironments. For example, agricultural lands in Barcelona are\\nmost dissimilar to those in Budapest. Airports in Barcelona are\\nmost similar to those in Athens, and most dissimilar to those in\\nBerlin and Budapest. Barcelonas forests and parks are most dissim-\\nilar to Budapests. Water bodies in Barcelona are very dissimilar to\\nall other cities. /T_his point is enforced by Figure 11 below, which\\nsuggests that areas marked as water bodies in Barcelona are ocean\\nwaterfronts, whereas this class for all other cities represents rivers\\nor lakes.Figure 11: Samples from three urban environments across\\nour 6 example cities. We sampled the 2-d t-SNE embedding\\nof Figure 9 and queried for the closest real sample to the\\ncentroid using an ecient KD-tree search.\\nFinally, we explore the feature maps extracted by the convolu-\\ntional model in order to illustrate how similar the six cities we\\nused throughout this analysis are across three example environ-\\nments, green urban areas, water bodies, and medium density urban\\nfabric. For each city and land use class, we start o the centroid of\\nthe point cloud in the 2-d space of Figure 9, and /f_ind the nearest\\nseveral samples using the KD-tree method described in Section 4.\\nWe present the results in Figure 11. Visual inspection indicates\\nthat the model has learned useful feature maps about urban envi-\\nronments: the sample image patches show a very good qualitative\\nagreement with the region of the space where theyre sampled from,\\nindicated by the land use class of neighboring points. /Q_ualitatively,\\nit is clear that the features extracted from the top layer of the con-\\nvolutional model allow a comparison between urban environments\\nby high-level concepts used in urban planning.',\n",
              " '6 CONCLUSIONS\\n/T_his paper has investigated the use of convolutional neural net-\\nworks for analyzing urban environments through satellite imagery\\nat the scale of entire cities. Given the current relative dearth of\\nlabeled satellite imagery in the machine learning community, we\\nhave constructed an open dataset of over 140 ,000 samples over 10\\nconsistent land use classes from 6 cities in Europe. As we continue\\nto improve, curate, and expand this dataset, we hope that it can help\\nother researchers in machine learning, smart cities, urban planning,\\nand related /f_ields in their work on understanding cities.\\nWe set out to study similarity and variability across urban envi-\\nronments, as being able to quantify such pa/t_terns will enable richer\\napplications in topics such as urban energy analysis, infrastructure\\nbenchmarking, and socio-economic composition of communities.\\nWe formulated this as a two-step task: /f_irst predicting urban land\\nuse classes from satellite imagery, then turning this (rigid) clas-\\nsi/f_ication into a continuous spectrum by embedding the features\\nextracted from the convolutional classi/f_ier into a lower-dimensional\\nmanifold. We show that the classi/f_ication task achieves encour-\\naging results, given the large variety in physical appearance of\\nurban environments having the same functional class. Moreover,we exemplify how the features extracted from the convolutional\\nnetwork allow for identifying neighbors of any given query im-\\nage, allowing a rich comparison analysis of urban environments by\\ntheir visual composition.\\n/T_he analysis in this paper shows that some types urban envi-\\nronments are easier to infer than others, both in the intra- and\\ninter-city cases. For example, in all our experiments, the models\\nhad most trouble telling apart high, medium, and low den-\\nsity urban environments, a/t_testing to the subjectivity of such a\\nhigh-level classi/f_ication for urban planning purposes. However,\\nagricultural lands, forests, and airports tend to be visually similar\\nacross dierent cities - and the amount of relative dissimilarity can\\nbe quanti/f_ied using the methods in this paper. Green urban areas\\n(parks) are generally similar to forests or to leisure facilities, and\\nthe models do be/t_ter in the intra-city case than predicting across\\ncities. How industrial areas look is again less geography-speci/f_ic:\\ninter-city similarity is consistently larger than intra-city similarity.\\nAs such, for several classes we can expect learning to transfer from\\none geography to another. /T_hus, while it is not news that some\\ncities are more similar than others (Barcelona is visually closer to\\nAthens than it is to Berlin), the methodology in this paper allows\\nfor a more quantitative and practical comparison of similarity.\\nBy leveraging satellite data (available virtually world-wide), this\\napproach may allow for a low-cost way to analyze urban envi-\\nronments in locations where ground truth information on urban\\nplanning is not available. As future directions of this work, we\\nplan to i)continue to develop more rigorous ways to compare and\\nbenchmark urban neighborhoods, going deeper to physical ele-\\nments (vegetation, buildings, roads etc.); ii)improve and further\\ncurate the open Urban Environments dataset; and iii)extend this\\ntype of analysis to more cities across other geographical locations.\\nA PRACTICAL TRAINING DETAILS.\\nWe split our training data into a training set (80% of the data) and a\\nvalidation set (the remaining 20%). /T_his is separate from the data\\nsampled for the ground truth raster grids for each city, which we\\nonly used at test time. We implemented the architectures in the\\nopen-source deep learning framework Keras7(with a TensorFlow8\\nbackend). In all our experiments, we used popular data augmenta-\\ntion techniques, including random horizontal and vertical /f_lipping\\nof the input images, random shearing (up to 0 .1 radians), random\\nscaling (up to 120%), random rotations (by at most 15 degrees either\\ndirection). Input images were 224 2243 pixels in size (RGB\\nbands). For all experiments, we used stochastic gradient descent\\n(with its Adadelta variant) to optimize the network loss function (a\\nstandard multi-class cross-entropy), starting with a learning rate of\\n0.1, and halving the rate each 10 epochs. We trained our networks\\nfor at most 100 epochs, with 2000 samples in each epoch, stopping\\nthe learning process when the accuracy on the validation set did\\nnot improve for more than 10 epochs. Given the inherent imbalance\\nof the classes, we explicitly enforced that the minibatches used for\\ntraining were relatively balanced by a weighted sampling proce-\\ndure. For training, we used a cluster of 4 NVIDIA K80 GPUs, and\\ntested our models on a cluster of 48 CPUs.\\n7\\n8www.tensor/f_low.org']"

            "Summary dictionary for satellite_imagery.pdf : {'ABSTRACT': 'Urban planning applications, including energy audits and investments, necessitate a comprehensive understanding of built infrastructure and its environment, encompassing both low-level physical features and higher-level concepts like socio-economic land use classes. Obtaining such data is costly and labor-intensive, posing challenges, especially in developing countries. Our approach involves analyzing land use patterns in urban areas using large-scale satellite imagery and advanced computer vision techniques. We leverage deep convolutional neural networks, train models on a dataset derived from open-source surveys, specifically the Urban Atlas classification dataset, and make our findings and dataset accessible to machine learning researchers for remote-sensing applications.', '1 INTRODUCTION': 'Urban land use classification plays a crucial role in various applications, including urban planning, zoning, business permits, real estate, and infrastructure development. Traditionally, this task is labor-intensive and infrequent, limiting data availability in developing countries. However, advancements in satellite technology and deep learning models for image classification enable a more democratic and inclusive analysis of urban environments. This paper contributes to deep learning literature and smart cities studies by contrasting convolutional architectures, such as VGG-16 and ResNet, for land use classification using a novel dataset from 10 European cities. The dataset, publicly available, pairs ground truth labels from the Urban Atlas survey with satellite imagery, facilitating automated classification in data-poor regions. The work emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive understanding of urban environments for future analyses and algorithm development. The paper reviews related studies, describes the curated dataset, details the deep learning architectures, and concludes with code availability for transparency and reproducibility.', '2 LITERATURE': 'This paper delves into the intersection of remote sensing data and machine learning, specifically deep learning architectures, for studying urban environments. It highlights the recent emergence of deep learning methods in land use classification using satellite imagery, citing early studies utilizing convolutional neural networks on datasets like UC Merced and DeepSat. The work emphasizes the scarcity of benchmark datasets for land use classification and discusses existing efforts, including projects like TerraPattern and DeepOSM, which use open-source data for similar purposes. The paper also touches on related studies that explore urban environments using other imagery sources like Google Street View and ground-level imagery, as well as mobile phone call records for inferring land use classes.', '3 THE URBAN ENVIRONMENTS DATASET': 'The Urban Atlas, an open-source dataset, encompasses approximately 300 European cities, each with a population of over 100,000 inhabitants, providing standardized land use classifications. Originating from a European Union initiative between 2005-2011, the dataset includes 20 standardized land use classes organized in detailed polygons. For this study, 10 final classes were selected for analysis, reflecting higher-level socio-economic and cultural functions of land. The authors employed a carefully designed sampling strategy, leveraging freely-available data sources such as the Google Maps Static API, to obtain high-quality satellite imagery and ground truth labels for training convolutional architectures in urban environment classification. The resulting dataset covers six cities and is used for both training and validation, demonstrating a balance in land use classes and ensuring representative samples for analysis.', '4 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP': 'The paper conducts experiments comparing the VGG-16 and ResNet architectures for urban environment classification. Transfer learning is employed, with models pre-trained on ImageNet and DeepSat datasets before fine-tuning on the Urban Atlas dataset. Results indicate that pre-training on DeepSat and refining on Urban Atlas yields the best accuracy improvements. The study also explores the transferability of models across different geographical locations, focusing on the similarity of urban environments in cities like Berlin and Barcelona. Feature extraction is performed using the last layer of the convolutional architectures, and a KD-tree is constructed to quantify similarity in local urban environments.', '5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION': 'The study evaluates the performance of convolutional architectures, particularly ResNet-50, in classifying urban land use from satellite imagery across six European cities. Model predictions are compared with ground truth grids, demonstrating qualitative agreement in capturing urban land use classifications. Despite the complexity of the task, the models achieve satisfactory classification performance, especially when considering the challenging nature of high-level, subjective concepts in urban planning. The analysis further explores transfer learning across cities, per-class model performance, and the sensitivity of results to spatial scale, providing insights into the similarities and differences in urban environments. The study also employs t-SNE embeddings to visualize and compare urban land use classes across the six cities, highlighting variations and commonalities.', '6 CONCLUSIONS': 'In this paper, we present an adaptive knowledge distillation approach to improve NMT for low-resource languages. We address the inefficiency of the original transfer learning and multilingual learning by making wiser use of all high-resource languages and models in an effective collaborative learning manner.'}\n"

            "We analyze pa/t_terns in land use in urban neighborhoods using large-scale satellite imagery data and computer vision techniques based on deep convolutional neuralnetworks. We use this data to train and compare deep architectures which have recently shown good per-formance on standard computer vision tasks (image classi/f_ication and segmentation), including on geospatial data. CCS CONCEPTS: Computer vision; Neural net-agicallyworks; Applied computing Environmental sciences;KEYWORDS: Land use, satellite imagery,convolutional networks, land use class i/f/ication, convolutionian networks. The paper is based on the Urban Atlas land use dataset of 20 land use classes across 300 European cities. For more information, visit the CCS ConcepTS website. The study was published in the open-source journal, The Open Data Project (ODP) (http://www.opendataproject.org/doi/full/10.1177/1556/1555/1/2/2.1).\n",

            "Summary for 2 LITERATURE:\n",
            "Other applications have included predicting survey estimates on poverty levels in several countries in Africa by /f_irst learning. While useful as input for pre-training more complex models, (e.g., image segmentation), this dataset does not allow to take the further steps for detailed land use analysis and comparison of urban environments. We hope our dataset will address this gap. It contains two benchmarks: the Sat-4 data of 500,000 images over 4                land use classes ( barren land, trees, grassland, other ), and theSat-6 data of 405,000 image over 6 land use classes. It also includes a crowd-sourced mechanism for collecting ground truth labeling to predict subjective perceptions of Urban environments such as beauty, wealth, and liveliness. The dataset is currently only 1-2 years old, but we hope it will be used for future research. It is available for download from the /f-irst website.

            "Summary for 3 THE URBAN ENVIRONMENTS DATASET:\n",
            "The Urban Atlas dataset is a comprehensive and consistent survey at a largescale. Because of the wide disparity in the spatial distribution of dierent land use classes and across dierent cities, we chose to consolidate severalclasses from the original dataset. The sampling procedure for collecting training data is described in detail below. We chose expressly to use the Urban Atlas datasets over other sources. The data was collected from satellite images of urban areas in the U.S. and Europe. The results of this study will be published in the Journal of Urban and Regional Planning (JUARP) in the spring of 2014. The cost of the project was $1.2 million, and we expect to make a further $1 million by the end of the year. For more information, visit JUARP.org. The study was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison). The author gratefully acknowledges the NSF’s support for the study.\n",

            "Summary for 4 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP:\n",
            "Given the large amount of variation in the visual appearance of urban environments across dierent cities, it is of interest to study to what extent a model learned on one geographical location can be applied to a dierent geographicallocation. We have implemented the following approaches: 1)we used models pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, then further /f_ine-tuned them on the Urban Atlas dataset. 2)we pre- trained on the DeepSat dataset (See Section 2.2), then further re/f_ined on theUrban Atlas dataset, achieving around 5% accuracy for a given training time. And 3)we have experimented with training our models on the problem of                interest (urban environment classi/fication) starting from architec-reprehensible data and then transferring it to other domains ( transfer learning ). This procedure has been shown to yield both be/t_ter performance and faster training times, as the network already has learned to recognize basic shapes and pa/t-terns that are characteristic of ima-repertoire across many domains.\n",
            "\n",
            "Summary for 5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:\n",
            "For most cities, classes such as low density urbanFabric, forests, and water bodies are well-resolved. However, more subjective, high-level urban-planning concepts such as high density urban fabric are harder to infer. As more researchers tackle problems with the aid of satellite imagery, more open-source data will be available. For more information on how to use satellite imagery for machine learning, see the OpenStreetMap.com/Map/OpenStreetMap-Urban-Planning-Machine-Artificial-Intelligent-Intelligence (A/A) toolkit.

            "Summary for 6 CONCLUSIONS:\n",
            "We set out to study similarity and variability across urban envi-                ronments, as being able to quantify such pa/t_terns will enable richer applications. While it is not news that some municipalities are more similar than others, the methodology in this paper allows a more quantitative and practical comparison of similarity. We plan to continue to develop more rigorous ways to compare andbenchmark urban neighborhoods, going deeper to physical ele-                ments (vegetation, buildings, roads etc. The open Urban Environments dataset will be expanded to include more cities across other geographical locations. It will also be used for urban energy analysis, infrastructurebenchmarking, and socio-economic composition of communities.
